Go here for the backend: https://github.com/topdreg/appBack

To use:
1) run npm install in the root directory of both appFront and appBack
2) connect Android Studio and either open a phone emulator and connect a phone
3) run "react-native start" in appFront directory
4) run "DEBUG=myapp:* npm start" in appBack directory
5) run "react-native run-android" in appFront directory.

iOS support will come along eventually.
